.. warning ::

    Advanced SQLAlchemy experience required.

As the maturity of this project is very alpha, there aren't yet specific starting instructions.
You need to understand SQLAlchemy basics before you can start working on it.
However, as the project matures more comprehensive tutorials will follow.

For the examples, see ``test_block_io.py`` which stresses out Bitcoin and Dogecoin
using *block.io* backend.

**Walkthrough**

* Create an SQLAlchemy models in your database by importing your
  supported currencies from cryptoassets.core.coin and running `
  ``Base.metadata.create_all()``.

* Create a backend object and register it

* Get or create a default ``Wallet`` instance for your application

* Use ``Wallet`` to create account, then create address inside it

* Send in a transaction to this address

* You need to have external receiver process communicating with the network
  and then writing the transaction when it arrives (see ``test_send_receive_external``
  and ``setup_receiving``)

* Check that the address balance, account balance and wallet balances are updated
